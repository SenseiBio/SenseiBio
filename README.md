- 👋 Hi, we are @SenseiBio, a clinical phase immuno-oncology company. 
- 👀 We learn cancer's design. https://www.senseibio.com/
- 🌱 Sensei is developing a pipeline of investigational medicines that have potential to alter the relationship between host immune cells and cancer so that the immune system recognizes tumors as a threat and unleashes an immune response.
- 💞️ We’ve built a pipeline of investigational therapies that are designed to work selectively in the tumor microenvironment. These conditionally active antibodies are expected to unlock previously undruggable targets and may offer new treatment options for cancer patients.
- 📫 Reach me info@senseibio.com
